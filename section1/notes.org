**Syntax** is how you write something
**Semantics** is what it means

Static environment: type checking, exist before the program evaluates
Dynamic environment

Every expression has 3 things:
- Syntax
- Type checking rules: produces a type or a fail
- Evaluation rules: produces a result, error message, or infinite loop


All values are expressions (they always evaluate to themselves**
Not all expressions are values

Shadowing :: add a variable to an environment, when there's already that variable in that environment

Binding = giving names to things in a given well delimited context
Assigning = storing things in some location

When understand anything, there are always 3 rules: syntax rule, type checking rule, and evaluation rule
